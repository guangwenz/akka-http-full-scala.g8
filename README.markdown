[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guangwenz/akka-http-full-scala.g8.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guangwenz/akka-http-full-scala.g8)

# Introduction

Build reactive web service on top of Akka HTTP, Akka Cluster, Akka Persistence and Slick.
please see the [Akka document](https://akka.io/docs/) for a quick reference.
can be easily deployed to containerized environment like kuberetes

Prerequisites:
- JDK 8
- sbt 0.13.13 or higher

Open a console and run the following command to apply this template:
```
sbt new guangwenz/akka-http-full-scala.g8
```

This template will prompt for the following parameters. Press `Enter` if the default values suit you:
- `name`: Becomes the name of the project.
- `package`: Becomes the base package for the project
- `actorSystemName`: Becomes the default name of the actor
- `akkaManagementVersion`: Specifies the akka management version
- `slickProfile`: the slick profile to use, check [Slick document](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.1/supported-databases.html) for supported databases.
- `scala_version`: Specifies the Scala version for this project.
- `akka_http_version`: Specifies which version of Akka HTTP should be used for this project.
- `akka_version`: Specifies which version of Akka should be used for this project.
- `organization`: Specifies the organization for this project.

The template comes with the following package layout:
* `application` -- application tier reusable components by actors.
* `common` -- domain common code, like enums, domain level shared components.
* `dao` -- database access table queries, entities and repositories, I created readonly repository and transaction repository, it's good practice to separate reading and writing operations for database access.
* `utils` -- some util classes.
* `Boot.scala` -- Main class for the system
* `Routes.scala` -- routes for the system, add your domain routes here.
* `AkkaConfig.scala` -- akka config utility object to initialize akka configs.

Once inside the project folder, configure the slick connections to use your databases inside `src/main/resources/akka-datastore.conf`, please refer to [HikariCP](http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) for the db connection and pool settings for details, the default is using MySQL

after setup datbase, use the following command to run the code:
```
sbt run
```
then open http://localhost:8080 to see the swagger page!
